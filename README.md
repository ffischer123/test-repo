Machine Learning Project
=========

This is a Jupyter file summarizing a project that models energy output based on average temperatures and other variables.

The file is a working document that progresses as follows:

- Data loading from .csv file on local drive
- Data analysis / visualization (histograms, scatter plots, correlations)
- Manual linear model with single explanatory variable / visualization - this is for training purposes
- Linear model with one feature fitted with scikit-learn
- Linear model with all features
- Use of train / test data & evaluation of model fit
- Random Forest model
- Use of train / test data & evaluation of model fit

Please reach out if you have questions.
